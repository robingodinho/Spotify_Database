## Business Problem
In today's music streaming industry, delivering personalized user experiences is essential for retaining users and enhancing engagement. Streaming platforms like Spotify need to understand individual user preferences to create more meaningful, data-driven music recommendations. However, raw data alone cannot produce actionable insights. It requires thorough analysis and tailored queries to reveal user trends and behaviors, allowing for optimized recommendation engines and personalized music suggestions.

## Solution Approach
This project addresses the business problem by:
1. **Data Extraction**: Integrating with the Spotify API to collect comprehensive user data, such as listening history, track metadata, and playlist details.
2. **Data Storage and Querying**: Utilizing SQL for efficient data storage and analysis. This database facilitates customized queries to derive insights into user listening patterns.
3. **Personalized Recommendations**: Analyzing user data to provide unique and personalized music recommendations based on historical listening habits. This includes generating suggestions for songs, genres, and artists, tailored specifically to the user.

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Utilizes the Spotify API to retrieve a user's music data, including listening history, favorite tracks, artists, and playlists.
- **Data Storage**: Stores Spotify data in a SQL database for efficient querying and analysis.
- **Music Trend Analysis**: Analyzes user listening habits to uncover insights such as top genres, most played artists, and preferred listening times.
- **Personalized Music Recommendations**: Generates custom music recommendations by running tailored SQL queries against the userâ€™s listening data.

## Technologies Used
- **Spotify API**: Used to retrieve user music data and metadata.
- **SQL**: Employed to create, manage, and query the database for analysis.
- **Python**: (Optional) Scripts may be included for API data extraction, transformation, and loading into the SQL database.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Spotify Developer Account**: Sign up at the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/) to obtain an API key.
- **Python 3.6+**: For data extraction scripts (if used).
- **SQL Database**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, or any other preferred SQL database platform.

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spotify-music-database.git
   cd spotify-music-database
   ```
2. **Set up the Spotify API**:
   - Create a new app on the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/).
   - Note your Client ID and Client Secret.
3. **Configure Database**:
   - Create a new database using your preferred SQL platform.
   - Run the provided SQL scripts to create tables and structure the database.

4. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   - Add your Spotify credentials and database connection details in an `.env` file or directly in the scripts (not recommended for production).

## Running the Project
1. **Extract Data from Spotify**:
   - Run the Python script (if provided) to pull data from Spotify and load it into the SQL database:
     ```bash
     python scripts/extract_data.py
     ```
   
2. **Analyze Data and Generate Recommendations**:
   - Use the provided SQL scripts to query the database and analyze user listening trends.
   - Recommendations can be generated based on insights from analysis, such as top genres or frequently skipped songs.

## Example Queries
- **Top 10 Most Played Songs**:
  ```sql
  SELECT track_name, COUNT(*) AS play_count 
  FROM play_history 
  GROUP BY track_name 
  ORDER BY play_count DESC 
  LIMIT 10;
  ```

- **Weekly Listening Trends**:
  ```sql
  SELECT EXTRACT(DOW FROM played_at) AS day_of_week, COUNT(*) AS total_plays 
  FROM play_history 
  GROUP BY day_of_week 
  ORDER BY day_of_week;
  ```

## Future Improvements
- Implement machine learning algorithms for more complex recommendation systems.
- Integrate data visualization to create dashboards for user insights.
- Expand the scope to include collaborative filtering for friend-based music recommendations.
